TL;DR, pull requests are accepted for this project, but don't expect active maintenance.

This project was forked from the original ldlite project to enable support for RTR
and may or may not be maintained moving forward. I may accept pull requests, but don't expect fast
action on them. Feel free to create your own fork, as we're rocking an Apache 2.0 license, just
like the original.
